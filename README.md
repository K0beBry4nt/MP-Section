Update 11.18: Section 1 code part has been done. Need add: explanation and text
i (frankie) will add the explainations
Update 11.22: Section 2 and 3 has done. Need add:
1.Section 2 explanation and text.
2.Section 3 need some minor changes as I used more AI than I thought I should've used. However if you think this code is fine I think that's OK.
I (Ruihan Xiao)have added the explainations of section 2, if you guys have question can directly revise my code or ask me in whatsapp to revise.
What's going on: Section 4 and 5 will be started soon (might not be all done)

Finished project has been submitted! submitted as Project7FennelGrayJefferyLiuXiao.ipnyb (was told to submit it with that file name)
