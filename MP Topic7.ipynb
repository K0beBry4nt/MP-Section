The idea is quite straightforward: each branch is represented as a line from one point to another, and for the next depth we let every branch grow three new branches at its tip. The new branches are shorter than the previous one and they point in different directions given by fixed angles. This repeating rule creates the fractal-like structure.\n",

    "The function `make_tree` handles this construction. Starting from the trunk, it works out the length and direction of the current branch. If we reach the final depth, it adds three short “leaf” branches and marks them as leaves. Otherwise it creates three child branches, marks them as ordinary branches, and then calls itself recursively on each of them. By the end, this gives a list of line segments together with a tag telling us whether the segment is a brown branch or a green leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the animation part we follow the same style as in Section 1. The function `animate_tree` opens a pygame window, and then draws the segments one by one, so the user can actually see the tree being built. Branches are drawn in brown and the leaves in green, as required. The user can press the space bar to start or pause the animation, and Esc to quit. I also added a simple speed control through a global `SPEED_FACTOR`, which directly affects the frame rate so the tree can be drawn faster or more slowly depending on the user’s choice.\n",

    "**(core)** In this section we investigate how to produce and plot Julia sets, and display a sequence of images of these sets as an animated film. These Julia sets have parameter $j_p = 0.7885e^{{\\alpha}i}$, for small non-negative $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We generate 200 image files - one for each Julia set as $\\alpha$ takes 200 different values. These are then played in a sequence, using a `pygame` animation, to produce a film of the varying sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(Explanation)** In this section we create code that generates animated Julia set fractals as required in the question.\n",
     "In general, the three main parts are: `julia_escape_smooth`, which creates a smooth Julia fractal image; `generate_julia_frames`, which creates a sequence of Julia set images; and `play_frames_pygame`, which plays the saved images.\n",
     "The `julia_escape_smooth` function creates a grid of complex numbers (`Z`) and iterates the function tracking how quickly each point escpaes beyond the radius **R**, using a smooth gradient. The points that dont escape beofre `max_iter` are assigned the maximum value.  The function returns a 2D array of escape-time values that can be plotted as a fractal image. \n",
     "The function `generate_julia_frames` creates an output folder, generates `n_frames` evenly spaced angles from $0$ to $2 \pi$. For each angle, it computes $c = r e ^ (ia)$ and calls `julia_escape_smooth` to create a fractal image. It then saves each frame as `julia_000.png`, `julia_001.png` etc and returns the folder holding the images. This can be turned into an animation. \n",
     "The `play_frames_pygame` function uses Pygame to load all the images in the folder and playback the frames like a video in a loop. It also allows for interactive control. \n",
