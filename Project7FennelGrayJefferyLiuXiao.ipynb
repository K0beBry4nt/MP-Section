    "A common example of a fractal object, formed from a recursive process, is the Sierpinski triangle. This object consists of a triangle with sides of a set length, inside which a smaller triangle is first drawn, dividing the larger triangle into four identical triangular-shaped regions. Three more triangles are then drawn in each space between the original triangle and the first triangle drawn, dividing those three spaces into four identical regions respectively. This process is then repeated to infinity to form the full Sierpinski triangle; for this project we will only repeat the process to a limited depth, but we will explore how to animate this process by adapting given functions and using the `pygame` library."

The idea is quite straightforward: each branch is represented as a line from one point to another, and for the next depth we let every branch grow three new branches at its tip. The new branches are shorter than the previous one and they point in different directions given by fixed angles. Repeating the process in this way creates the fractal-like structure.\n",

If we reach the final depth, it adds three short “leaf” branches and marks them as leaves. Otherwise it creates three child branches, marks them as ordinary branches, and then calls itself recursively on each of them. By the end, this gives a list of line segments together with a tag telling us whether the segment is a brown branch or a green leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the animation part we follow the same style as in Section 1. The function `animate_tree` opens a `pygame` window, and then draws the segments one by one, so the user can actually see the tree being constructed. Branches are drawn in brown and the leaves in green, as required. The user can press the space bar to start or pause the animation, and `Esc` to quit. Simple speed control has been added through a global `SPEED_FACTOR`, which directly affects the frame rate so that the tree can be drawn faster or more slowly, depending on the user’s choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper functions `run_tree()` and `speed_tree()` allow the user to enter the depth and the speed before starting the animation, keeping the interface consistent with the Sierpinski triangle functions in the previous section."

These Julia sets have parameter $j_p = 0.7885e^{{\\alpha}i}$, for small non-negative $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We generate 200 image files - one for each Julia set as $\\alpha$ takes 200 equally spaced values between $0$ and $2\\pi$. These are then played in a sequence, using a `pygame` animation, to produce a film of the sets as they vary. \n",

    "\n",
    "The `julia_escape_smooth` function creates a grid of complex numbers (`Z`) and iterates the function, tracking how quickly each point escpaes beyond the radius **R**, using a smooth gradient. The points that don't escape before reaching the maximum iteration `max_iter` are assigned their maximum value.  The function returns a 2D array of escape-time values that can be plotted as a fractal image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_julia_frames` creates an output folder, and generates a number of evenly spaced angles $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $ 2  π $, which is defined as `n_frames` - this value is initialised to 200 when the function is run. For each angle, it computes $c = r e ^{(ia)}$ and calls `julia_escape_smooth` to create a fractal image for this value of $\\alpha$. It then saves each frame as `julia_000.png`, `julia_001.png`, etc. and returns a folder storing the images. These images can then be displayed in sequence to produce an animation of the variation of the sets. \n",

    "- **Quit** - closes window\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation is performed one step at a time, with the speed of animation based on the variable `speed_delay`; the discs move directly from one pole to another, without showing intermediate steps, and the animation stops when all the moves have been completed and the solution reached.\n"

    "The main purpose of this project was to explore the abilities of recursive functions and animations, with the goal of using both to produce graphical, easily understood animations of the solutions to mathematical problems. The first three sections focused on developing these methods, using them to display images, while the last three focused on applying them to a problem. This goal has been achieved successfully, as we have been able to produce an interactive, developed animation of the solution to the Towers of Hanoi problem. Furthering understanding of the solutions to problems is the main purpose of animations, so adding interactive elements to the animations may have been the most useful part of achieving our aim; interactive animations allow a user to better understand how a solution works at their own pace.
